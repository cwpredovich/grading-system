I want to keep track of how much time I dedicate to this project.
So far, I've put about 2 to 3 weeks of hard work into it.
The project was a originally aimed at being a test of my skills for an interview for a software company called SoftServe.
When the company decided not to hire me, I was discouraged and stopped working on this app for awhile.

Work Accomplished:
Finished the HTML and CSS redesign to match the frontend design that I want to go with:
"./grading-system/frontend_design/affinity_designs/seconditeration.jpg"
The redesigned wireframe is coded here:
"./grading-system/client/src/AppReimagined.js"
and
"./grading-system/client/src/AppReimagined.css"

I feel great about the redesign. I'm proud of my work. I used a lot of CSS Grid (and Flexbox) resources found on W3 Schools, Stack Overflow, and CSS Tricks.

Next Up:
> I need to wire up the frontend so that it's functional, not just pretty.
> After that, I need to spend a good amount of time bug hunting and bug squashing.
> When all of that is done, I really really really want to add authentication.

Work Goal:
Fix bugs!
I wanted to fix the bug that caused the app to crash whenever new students were added without any courses.

Problem code:
if (newCourses[0].courseName) {}

Browser error:
cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'courseName') Students2.js:90

I looked at line 90 of Students2.js file. That's the problem code.
At first, I thought maybe I could check if newCourses is truthy before allowing the form to be submitted. So, I wrote:

if (newCourses && newCourses[0].courseName) {}

But I kept getting the same error. So, I tried something else. I tried submitting a new student without any courses, but also without clicking the add new courses button. That worked! The browser alerted me that I need to add at least one course.
