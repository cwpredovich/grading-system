I want to keep track of how much time I dedicate to this project.
So far, I've put about 2 to 3 weeks of hard work into it.
The project was a originally aimed at being a test of my skills for an interview for a software company called SoftServe.
When the company decided not to hire me, I was discouraged and stopped working on this app for awhile.

Work Accomplished:
Finished the HTML and CSS redesign to match the frontend design that I want to go with:
"./grading-system/frontend_design/affinity_designs/seconditeration.jpg"
The redesigned wireframe is coded here:
"./grading-system/client/src/AppReimagined.js"
and
"./grading-system/client/src/AppReimagined.css"

I feel great about the redesign. I'm proud of my work. I used a lot of CSS Grid (and Flexbox) resources found on W3 Schools, Stack Overflow, and CSS Tricks.

Next Up:
> I need to wire up the frontend so that it's functional, not just pretty.
> After that, I need to spend a good amount of time bug hunting and bug squashing.
> When all of that is done, I really really really want to add authentication.
